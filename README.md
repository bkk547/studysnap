# 🎧 StudySnap

**StudySnap** is a tool I built from scratch to solve a problem I kept running into: long lectures, messy notes, and no time to review. I wanted something that could take a voice recording and turn it into something useful — a clean transcript and a short summary I could actually study from.

So I built it myself.

StudySnap lets you upload or record audio, transcribes it using speech recognition, and summarizes it using natural language processing. It’s fast, simple, and designed to help students and professionals learn smarter.

## 🧠 Why I Built It

I was lowkey tired of rewatching lectures and digging through notebooks trying to find what mattered. I thought: what if I could just record the lecture, and get a summary of the key points?

That’s where StudySnap started.

I built the entire stack myself — the frontend in React, the backend in Node.js, and the microservice in Python. I used DeepSpeech for transcription and Hugging Face for summarization. I designed the UI to be clean and intuitive, with features like transcript history, editable summaries, and custom labels for each recording.

This project taught me how to:
- Architect a full-stack app from scratch
- Work with audio and natural language
- Design a user-friendly interface
- Debug real-world problems and optimize performance
